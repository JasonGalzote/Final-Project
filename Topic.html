  <h3> Why downloading music should be legal </h3>
  
  <h4>Legal:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Downloading musics off the internet is a great way to save money as artists will make you pay cash for listening to a soundtrack and an app called Spotify allows you to listen to music but however you must pay to upgrade to premium for only $4.99 as lets you can download musics when you're on offline mode and also gets rid of ads as well.
    
    <br>
    
    <li>On the internet, there are two types of converters that allows either Youtube Videos or Soundcloud Audio to be converted into an MP3 file and allowing you to download music off the internet.
    
    <br>
    
    <li>On the website called Techradar on February 22, 2017, by Gary Marshall, he made a list of the top 5 best youtube converters for PC and Mac. At Number 1, there is an app called aTube Catcher that it supports AVI, FLV, MOV, WMV, MPG and MP4, in addition to less common formats such as PSP, which is used for Sony's handheld games console.
  
  </ul>

  <h4>illegal:</h4>
   <p>Downloading music files off the internet that is copyrighted and you are not authorized to hold one, is a federal offense because you obtained someone else's work of music on your computer that you are in possession of copyrighted material which you did not pay for, thus this is illegal, and you will face charges against copyright infringement with a fine up to $200 to $150,000 for each of the work you infringed.</p>
   
   <br>
   
   <p>This affect also applies to burning compact discs of music or even movies that you have not made a purchase from a retailer as it would hurt the economy of the author who made this or the director of a movie.
